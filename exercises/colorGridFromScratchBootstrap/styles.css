At screen widths below 768px, each colored section
should span the screen. At 768px and wider, the sections
should be twice the height and with larger margins between them.
--- top row: pink still spans the screen width
--- second row: four equal fuchsia sections
--- third row: two equal aqua sections
--- fourth row: a green section on the left, 2/3 - 3/4 of the total width
and a dark orange section on the right, 1/4 - 1/3 total width. */
