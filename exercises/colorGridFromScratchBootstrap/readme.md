Assignment: Create the color grid to be responsive using Bootstrap.
At screen widths below 768px, each color section
should span the screen. At 768px and wider, the sections
should be twice the height and with larger margins between them.
--- top row: pink still spans the screen width
--- second row: four equal fuchsia sections
--- third row: two equal aqua sections
--- fourth row: a green section on the left, 2/3 - 3/4 of the total width
and a dark orange section on the right, 1/4 - 1/3 total width.

Skills: CSS, Bootstrap

Status: Completed in terms of class requirements, but I'd like to get it working without the 
white borders used to fake margins. (The Bootstrap column gutters never showed up, and I'd like
to find out why. Also, I want if there is a Bootstrap way of adjusting row height and other things
or if Bootstrap uses media queries.
