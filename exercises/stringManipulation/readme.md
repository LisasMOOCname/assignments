Assignment: Using the NodeJS package readline-sync, create an interactive program that asks for personal information (name, age, favorite color, etc.) and reports back what was entered. Include the following string manipulations:
--- make one of the inputs all uppercase (i.e., given the string “hello” prints “HELLO”)
--- report back the number of characters in a given input
--- concatenate two strings
--- given a message of more than twenty letters, return only the last half of the message
--- using the same message without making the user type it in again, print it to the terminal, but allow the user to specify where to begin typing from (i.e., which index to start from).

Store all input in a variable using the question method of the readline-sync package.
Use special string characters such as the newline character \n, or the tab character \t to make output more readable.
