Assignment: Build a React website with a form and a name badge with data from the form.
Badge field updates should only show after the Submit button is pressed.
Require each field to have input of at least 3 characters each.
If any of the input fields are empty, the Submit button should be disabled.
Validate that the phone number field only has numbers, no dashes or special characters, like this: 9757653323.

Optional:
1. Store new name badges in an array and display them using .map() so that each time a new badge is submitted, it instantly appears in the list.
2. Make the background color of the badge heading alternate on each list item (ie red, blue, red, blue (per the dynamic rendering writeup).
