Assignment: Create a form to collect data about airline passengers' upcoming travel plans so they can book their flight. Collect this information from the user:

First name (text input)
Last name (text input)
Age (number input)
Gender (radio buttons with 2 or more options)
Location they're traveling to (select box with at least 3 options. You're an airline that doesn't fly to many places...)
Whether they have any dietary restrictions (check boxes for vegetarian, kosher, lactose free, etc. Include at least 3 options)
Each element of the form should be given a name attribute so you can access the data in JavaScript and do stuff with it.
Put a button at the end of the form to submit it. Upon pressing the button, an alert should pop up showing the information.
