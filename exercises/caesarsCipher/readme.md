Assignment: Create a Caesar's cipher, in which each letter of an input string
is shifted a specified number of positions down the alphabet. For example, if the 
code is set to shift letters 3 positions, the letter "a" would be coded as "d."
Letters at the end of the alphabet would shift to the beginning, so "y" would
become "b." Non-alphabetical characters would remain unchanged. Two inputs will be
taken: the string and the number of places to shift each letter.
