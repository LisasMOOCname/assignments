Final version.

Assignment: Create a React app using props and .map().
The web page will dynamically display a series of vacation 
info cards showing a vacation place, price and time to go.

Extra credit for providing a background color for each card based on 
the time to go season.

Extra credit for displaying $, $$ or $$$ based on price. I didn't do
this because it didn't make sense to me. Dollar sign ratings are more to indicate a range when something has many prices, such as a menu. It
wouldn't be useful when an actual price is available. Also, the 
functionality wasn't much different than for the colors, so it
wouldn't have been a learning experience.
