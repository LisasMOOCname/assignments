<h2>Lesa Completes Cross-Country Drive, Starts V School</h2>
<p>Lesa has made it all the way to Utah without her car breaking down.</p>
<h3>Across the Prairie</h3>
<p>The route was flatland most of the way. Starting in Ohio and continuing through
    Indiana, Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, the typical view was of cornfields 
    stretching out to the horizon. Fewer cattle were visible on this trip than on the 
    drive made in 2001, perhaps because of the season. Happily, more radio stations
    playing rock music were available this time.
</p>
<h3>Windy Wyoming</h3>
Surprisingly, the plains did not have much wind, but signs around Laramie, Wyoming warned 
of 40+ mph gusts.
