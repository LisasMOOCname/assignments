<h2>V School November Class Starts</h2>
<p>Salt Lake City-based V School has started its November class in full-stack 
web development. Sixteen students are in the course cohort. Instructors Ben and Marcus 
have been covering the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript this week, with a brief intro
to Node.js.</p>
<p>Most of the students hope to find employment coding applications, though several also 
have projects that they plan to develop on their own, perhaps as the basis for their 
own business.
