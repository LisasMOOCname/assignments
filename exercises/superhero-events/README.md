Assignment: Build a React app that displays a list of superheroes with their names and images. When any part of a superhero component (name or image) is clicked, that superhero's catchphrase should show up in an alert box. The app should use:
--- a <SuperHero/> component
--- a JSON file where all the superhero information is stored
--- .map() to display the correct number of component instances (based on the number of superheroes in the JSON file
--- an event handler function that gets passed down to the child <SuperHero/> component

Skills: React

Status: Done except for a minor tweak to make the image sizes consistent, now that they're loading.
