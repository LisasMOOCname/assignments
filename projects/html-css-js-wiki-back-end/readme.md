Final project assignment: Create a full-stack, responsive single-page application using React, React Router, Node.js, Express Router and the Mongo database. The user must be able to make get, post, put and delete requests of the database.

Project Summary: 
Many reference sites, tutorials and classes exist online for HTML, CSS and Javascript, but they mostly teach basic syntax. People trying to learn how to code end up posting the same questions: "How do I center something on the page with CSS"? "How do I get a function to know which option was selected from my dropdown menu?" Answers too often involve using advanced code, libraries such as jQuery or tools such as Flexbox. Good answers are out there, but they're on different websites and sometimes buried in forum threads. It would be helpful to have one place to look, with information posted by topic.
A wiki is a website where people can view, post and edit (and delete) information about a topic. This project will be a repository of information about HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
Note of clarification: This is not a question-and-answer app. Users may search for answers to their questions, but it's a reference, a dynamic encyclopedia, not a message board or forum.

MVP:
The minimal product will consist of three web pages:
The website's landing page will be a search page featuring a search box and displaying a results list. 
Clicking on a list item will open a details page with the full answer (or set of answers) to that topic. 
The editing page is where users can post new question/answer topics, editing existing ones, or delete topics.
 This minimally viable product will not include signup or login functionality.

User stories:
1. A user can search on a topic such as "center" or "dropdown menu" to retrieve a list of relevant results.
2. The user can select an item from the results list to see the full entry, including text explanations, code and screenshots.
3. The user can return to the results list after viewing the full entry for an item.
4. The user can add a new wiki topic to the wiki.
5. The user can edit (update) any existing wiki entry.
6. The user can delete an existing wiki entry.
